LOLBAS stands for Living Off the Land Binaries And Scripts, a type of activity that misuses tools and executables that are already there because they are part of the operating system. To cite the [LOLBAS’ project’s criteria](https://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS#criteria), a LOLBin/lib/script must:

-   Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.
-   Have extra “unexpected” functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases.
-   Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team.
