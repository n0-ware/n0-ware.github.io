# Post Exploitation
## Description
(Usually) the last step in the attack after an attacker gains unauthorized access to a system. Typically involves
- [Privilege Escalation](../Vulnerabilities/Privilege%20Escalation%20(privsec).md)
- [Persistence](../Concepts/Offensive%20Security/Persistence.md)

This stage is where the attacker further enumerates their environment to further exploit other components of the greater network, or possible perform actions on objectives such as data exfiltration or deploying malware on the target. Further enumeration can be identifying other targets for compromise through the now locally available resources, identifying credentials they can access, gathering information for social engineering, and so on.
