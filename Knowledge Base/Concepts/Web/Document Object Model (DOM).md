# Document Object Model
DOM is a programming interface for `HTML` and `XML` documents. DOM represents the page in a way that other programs can alter the document structure, style, and content. Since a web page is just a document, it can be rendered in multiple ways, most commonly either in a browser or as the `HTML` source-code.
