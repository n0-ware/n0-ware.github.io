# Windows Registry
## Description
The Windows Registry is a large database of OS settings and configurations. It is organized by `hives` each one containing `keys` and `values`. Changes can be made according to a hive, such as for a user via the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` hive or on the entire system via the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` hive.
